void setup() {

  // In Example 14 we saw how to emulate a PushButton tile within HomeKit by automatically resetting a Characteristic so that
  // it "turns off" after a short period of time.  However, sometimes we want to be able to physically control a device with actual
  // PushButtons (or momentary switches) that trigger an action, such as turning on a light or fan, or opening a garage door.
  // Additionally, we want HomeKit to reflect any changes in the device as a result of such manual actions - HomeKit should know
  // when the light has been turned on or off manually.

  // One way to accomplish would be via custom code added to the loop() method of your derived Service that monitors the button,
  // checks when it is pressed, debounces button noise, performs some actions when pressed, and informs HomeKit of the actions with
  // the setVal() method. Or you can use HomeSpan's built-in SpanButton() object.

  // SpanButton() is a Service-level object, meaning it attaches itself to the last Service you define.  Typically you would instantiate
  // one of more SpanButton() objects directly inside the constructor for your derived Service.
  
  // SpanButton() supports three types of a triggers: a SINGLE button press, a DOUBLE press, and a LONG (extended) press.
  
  // The length of the presses needed to trigger these different types can be specified by optional arguments to SpanButton().
  // Since most buttons create spurious noise when pressed (and then again when released), the default time to trigger a SINGLE press is 5ms.
  // It's fine to change this to a longer value, but a shorter value is not recommended as this may allow spurious triggers unless
  // you debounce your switch with hardware.
  
  // The SpanButton() constructor takes 4 arguments, in the following order:
  //
  //  pin         - the pin number to which the PushButton is attached (required)
  //  longTime    - the minimum length of time (in milliseconds) the button needs to be pushed to be considered a LONG press (optional; default=2000 ms)
  //  singleTime  - the minimum length of time (in milliseconds) the button needs to be pushed to be considered a SINGLE press (optional; default=5 ms)
  //  doubleTime  - the maximum length of time (in milliseconds) between button presses to create a DOUBLE press (optional; default=200 ms)

  // When a SpanButton() is instantiated, it sets the specified pin on the ESP32 to be an INPUT with PULL-UP, meaning that the pin will
  // normally return a value of HIGH when read.  Your actual PushButton should be connected so that this pin is GROUNDED when the button
  // is pressed.

  // HomeSpan automatically polls all pins with associated SpanButton() objects and checks for LOW values, which indicates the button was
  // pressed, but not yet released.  It then starts a timer.  If the button is released after being pressed for less than singleTime milliseconds,
  // nothing happens.  If the button is released after being pressed for more than singleTime milliseconds, but for less than longTime milliseconds,
  // a SINGLE press is triggered, unless you press once again within doubleTime milliseconds to trigger a DOUBLE press.  If the button is held for more
  // than longTime milliseconds without being released, a LONG press is triggered. Once a LONG press is triggered the timer resets so that if you keep
  // holding the button, another LONG press will be triggered in another longTime milliseconds.  This continues until you finally release the button.    

  // Note if you set longTime > singleTime, SpanButton() will only trigger LONG presses.  Also, if you set doubleTime to zero, SpanButton() will not be
  // able to trigger a DOUBLE press.

  // To use SpanButton() within a derived Service you need to implement a button() method.  Similar to the loop() method, your button()
  // method will typically contain some combination of getVal() functions and setVal() functions, along with code that performs some set
  // of actions on the physical device (seting pins high or low, turning on fans, etc).  However, in contrast to the loop() method, which
  // is called by HomeSpan every polling cycle, HomeSpan only calls the button() method when a button attached to the Service registers a
  // SINGLE, DOUBLE, or LONG press.

  // Also in contrast with the loop method, the button() method takes two 'int' arguments, and should defined as follows:
  //
  // void button(int pin, int pressType)
  //
  // where "pin" is the pin number of the PushButton that was triggered, and pressType is set to 0 for a SINGLE press, 1 for a DOUBLE press,
  // and 2 for a LONG press.  You can also use the pre-defined constants SpanButton::SINGLE, SpanButton::DOUBLE, and SpanButton::LONG in place
  // of the numbers 0, 1, and 2 (this is recommended, though you will see in Example 16 why these integers can't be replaced by an C++ enum class).
  
  // Of course you can replace the variables "pin" and "pressType" with your own names.  The only requirement is the definition conform to
  // the "void button(int, int)" signature.  When HomeSpan first starts up it checks all Services containing one or more SpanButton() instances to
  // ensure you've implemented your own button(int, int) method.  If not, HomeSpan will print a warning message on the Serial Monitor.  Nothing bad
  // happens if you instantiate a SpanButton() but forget to create the button() method, or you create it with the wrong parameters. But nothing good
  // happens either - button presses are just ignored.
  //
  // C++ Note:  For an extra check, you can also place the the contextual keyword "override" after your method definition as such:
  //
  // void button(int buttonPin, int pressType) override {...your code...}
  //
  // Doing so allows the compiler to check that you are indeed over-riding the base class button() method and not inadvertently creating a new
  // button() method with an incorrect signature that will never be called by SpanButton().  In fact, you could add "override" to the definition
  // of your update() and loop() methods as well, since these are always supposed to over-ride the base-class method.

  // To demonstrate how SpanButtons works in practice, we will implement a Dimmable LED starting with the same LED code use in Example 11,
  // but with 3 SpanButton() objects performing different functions that showcase the different types of presses.
  //
  //  * A "power" SpanButton that will toggle the power in response a SINGLE press, turn on the power and set the brightness to a "favorite" level
  //    in response to the DOUBLE press, and set a new "favorite" level in response to a LONG press.
  //
  //  * A "raise brightness" SpanButton that will increase the brightness by 1% in response to a SINGLE press, repeatedly increase the brightness
  //    by 10% in response to a LONG press, and jump to the maximum brightness in response to a DOUBLE press.
  //
  //  * A "lower brightness" SpanButton that will decrease the brightness by 1% in response to a SINGLE press, repeatedly decrease the brightness
  //    by 10% in response to a LONG press, and jump to the minimum brightness in response to a DOUBLE press.
  
  // As usual, all the code is implemented in DEV_LED.h, with NEW! comments highlighting changes from Example 11.  You'll also notice that we've
  // extended the constructor for this version of our derived Dimmable LED Service to include the pin numbers for each of our buttons.
  // See DEV_LED.h for details.
